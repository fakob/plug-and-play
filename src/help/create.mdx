Your visual toolkit for creative prototyping, to explore, transform or visualise data.

Add and connect nodes

## Quickstart

1. Add nodes

   - Open _Search nodes_ by double clicking into the playground or press _Cmd/Ctrl+F_
   - There are many ready made nodes available, but you can also [_create your own_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11dS2uk3qdvrVBHGdu0af5c3NmpCylHUrxrkcu4oNexU/edit#heading=h.l22knu24xajp)

2. Connect them

3. They are executed right away

### Open an example playground

1. Click into _Search playgrounds_ or press _Cmd/Ctrl+O_
2. Select an existing playground

### Start a new playground

4. Click into _Search playgrounds_ or press _Cmd/Ctrl+O_
5. Give it a name
6. Click _Create empty playground_

OR Click [https://plugandplayground.dev/?new=true](https://plugandplayground.dev/?new=true)

## What data can be used?

Excel (Tabular data)TextImagesAnd whatever you get from an API

## How do I add and connect nodes?

### What are nodes?

A node can

- Get or represent data
- Transform data
- Display data

See [list of nodes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11dS2uk3qdvrVBHGdu0af5c3NmpCylHUrxrkcu4oNexU/edit#heading=h.94je4wsnhfom)

A node can have input and output sockets depending on its functionality.

### What are sockets?

Input sockets are exposed variables. Output sockets are

See list of socket types

### Search for nodes

To open the node search:

- double click the canvas
- press _Cmd/Ctrl-F_
- start dragging a connection and release the mouse

### Create a connection

1. Click and drag and input/output socket
2. Connect it to an output/input socket of another node

You can also just drag the connection onto the node and release the mouse. This will connect to the socket which fits best.

### Remove nodes

- Select a node and press Delete
- Right click a node and click "Delete"

### Remove a connection

- Click and unplug the input side of a connection
- Right click a socket and click "Remove connection"

### Change their update behaviour

By default, nodes update when one of their inputs updates. Change this behaviour using the node inspector on the right.

## What nodes are available?

## How do I create my own nodes?

### Create your own node

1. Open the node search
2. Find and add a Custom node
3. Select the added node and write your own JavaScript function in the code field

Tip: You can also just type a new name in the node search and create a custom node using the new name.

### Write your own function

A function is a block of JavaScript code that gets executed. You can add as many inputs as you like, process them and output the result.

Learn more about JavaScript functions

Tip: To write your function in a separate code editor

1. Unhide the Code input
2. Right click the input and choose "Connect CodeEditor"

## How do I import data?

- Drag in excel, text, image, video or database files
- OR get data from any API

## How do I transform data?

- Select the data you need and transform it using ready made nodes
- OR create your own nodes

## How do I visualise data?

- Use the drawing methods and composite them together
- If you want to reuse logic, create a macro

## How do I share my playgrounds?

We are a local first platform. To share your playgrounds online

1. Log in to Github
2. Store your playground as a Gist
3. Create a shareable link

Of course you can also just save the file locally and share it the old school way :-)

## My playground does not work. How can I fix it?

- Use the Console print node
- Use the Logger node
- Use the browsers devtools

## Start a new playground?
