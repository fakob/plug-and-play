import { Button } from '@mui/material';

Your visual toolkit for creative prototyping, to explore, transform or visualise data.

## Quickstart

1. Add nodes

   - `Double click` into the playground or press `Cmd/Ctrl+F` to open the node search
   - There are many ready made nodes available, but you can also create your own custom nodes

2. Connect them

   - `Click` on an input/output socket and drag to an output/input socket to create a connection

3. They are executed right away

### Open an example playground

1. Click into `Search playgrounds` or press `Cmd/Ctrl+O`
2. Select an existing playground

### Start a new playground

1. Click [NEW](https://plugandplayground.dev/?new=true) in the top header

## What data can be imported/used?

- Tabular data (xls, xlsm, xlsb, xlsx, csv, ods, numbers)
- Text (txt)
- Code (json, js)
- Image (jpg, png)
- Video (3gp, avi, flv, mov, mkv, m4v, mp4, ogg, qt, swf, webm, wmv)
- Sqlite (sqlite, sqlite3, db, db3, s3db, sl3)
- And whatever you get from an API

## What are nodes?

Nodes are building blocks that can be connected together to perform various tasks. They can

- Get or represent data
- Transform data
- Display data
- Wrap a group of nodes into a single node (Macro)
- Run a custom javascript function (Custom function)

To

- connect nodes, they have input and output `sockets` depending on their functionality
- execute them (calculate the outputs) you can specify the node's `update behaviour` defining how/when they should update.

### What nodes are available?

See _Nodes_

## What are sockets?

`Sockets` allow to input or output data. These are the available socket types:

- `Input sockets` allow for inputing data
  - constant values changeable via the **inspector**
  - OR data from an output socket connected to it
- `Output sockets` expose data outputted by the node
- `Trigger input` are used to trigger a node update

`Sockets` have a default `data type`, which can be changed. There is basic data parsing built in, to help transform between different data types. Not all data types are supported by all sockets. Here a list of available `data types`:

- any
- array
- boolean
- code
- color
- dataType
- deferredPixi
- dynamicEnum
- enum
- function
- image
- json
- number
- string
- trigger

## What is a node update behaviour?

Node outputs are calculated/updated depending on their update behaviour. You can combine the following options:

- `Update on change` (default for most nodes)
- `Update on interval`
  - Specify the interval in milliseconds
- Update via a `Trigger input`

## What is a node insepctor?

A node inspector allows you to inspect and edit all node specific parameters. To toggle the node inspector on the right side you can

- `Click` the socket name on the node
- `Click` the `Node inspector` icon in the top right of a node
- `Click` the `Node inspector` icon in the bottom right of the canvas
- `Right click` a node and select `Toggle node inspector`
- Press `Ctrl/Cmd+\`

To open a floating inspector for a specific socket

- `Shift+Click` the socket name on the node

## How do I add and connect nodes?

### Find and add the right node

1. To find the right node use the `node search`
   - `double clicking` the canvas
   - pressing `Cmd/Ctrl-F`
   - start dragging a connection and releasing the mouse
2. Enter a search term
3. Press `Enter`

OR open an example and copy/paste it into your own playground.

#### Remove a node

- Select a node and press `Delete`
- `Right click` a node and select `Delete`

### Create a connection

1. Click and drag and input/output socket
2. Connect it to an output/input socket of another node

_TIp: You can just drag the connection onto the node and release the mouse. This will connect to the first socket which fits best._

#### Remove a connection

- `Click` and unplug the input side of a connection
- `Right click` a socket and click `Remove connection`

### Change the update behaviour of a node

By default, most nodes update when one of their inputs update. To change this behaviour

1. Open the node inspector on the right
2. `Click` on Common
3. Choose a different update behaviour

#### Add a trigger input

1. `Right click` a node and select `Add trigger input`
2. `Click` the added socket name to open the `Node inspector`
3. Change the trigger method if necessary

##### What trigger methods are available?

- `positiveFlank`: triggered when the new value is **larger** than the previous one
- `negativeFlank`: triggered when the new value is **smaller** than the previous one
- `change`: triggered when the new value is **different** from the previous one
- `always`: triggere on every execution

## How do I import data?

- Drag in excel, text, code, image, video or database files
  - A node is created representing this data
- OR get data from any API using the `HTTP` node

## How do I transform data?

- Select the data you need and transform it using ready made nodes
- OR create your own node

### How do I create my own custom node?

1. Open the `Node search`
2. Find and add a `Custom` node
3. Select the added node and write your own JavaScript function in the code field

_Tip: You can also just type a new name in the node search and create a custom node using the new name._

#### Write your own JavaScript function

A function is a block of JavaScript code that gets executed. You can add as many inputs as you like, process them and output the result.

Learn more about [JavaScript functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)

_Tip: To write your function in a separate code editor_

1. Unhide the `Code` input socket by `clicking` on the `Eye` icon in the inspector
2. `Right click` the `Code` socket name and choose `Connect CodeEditor`

## How do I visualise data?

- Use the drawing nodes and composite them together
- If you want to reuse logic, create a macro
- See drawing examples for inspiration

## How do I create a macro?

A macro allows to group selected nodes into a single node and reuse it as often as you want.

1. Select a group of nodes which you want to reuse
2. `Right click` the selection and select `Extract to macro`
   - The selected nodes are placed inside a `Macro` node and connected inputs and outputs are exposed to the Macro

OR manually add a `Macro` node and place nodes inside it

### How do I use the macro?

1. Add an `Execute Macro` node
2. `Click` the `MacroName` input socket to open the inspector and select the macro to execute

## How do I share my playgrounds?

To share a playground online, we use Github Gists

1. `Click` on the `Share` button in the header
   - Log in to `Github` if not already done and click `Share` again
2. Optionally
   - add a description and name
   - choose if this link/Gist should be public or private
3. `Click` the `Share playground`
4. The playground is stored as a Gist and a shareable link is created

OR save the file locally and share it the old school way :-)

## My playground does not work. How can I fix it?

- Use the `Console print` node
- Use the `Logger` node
- Use the browsers devtools
