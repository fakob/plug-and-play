Plug and Playground is a visual toolkit for creative prototyping, to explore, transform or visualise data. It is

- open source
- local first
- and does not collect any data. Everything happens inside your browser!

## Problems we would like to solve

- As a programmer the threshold for fast and creative prototyping with code is too high.
- As a user with no/little programming knowledge I am creatively limited by complex prototyping or design tools.
- As a user who wants to visualize and/or interact with any data in a visual, quick and easy way my options are limited toby very narrowly focused tools.

## Goals to reach

- Provide an extensive library of nodes to receive, transform and visualise/output data
- Make it easy to jump between visual and real coding
- Make it easy to use for mouse, trackpad and keyboard people
- Make it easy to add nodes or libraries of others
- Allow for easy sharing, forking and collaborating
- Allow for sharing as read only or as a dashboard only showing exposed parameters or views
- Make the tool self explanatory and build in examples and options to document it
- Make it cross platform and open source

## Additional Plug and Playground resources

- `PnP companion`: a companion app which provides a way to get around CORS issues and handles things like authentication to API's when applicable - [Latest release](https://github.com/magnificus/pnp-companion-2/releases/latest)
- `PnP headless`: an app allowing to run playgrounds in headless mode - [Latest release](https://github.com/magnificus/pnp-headless/releases/latest)
