Plug and Playground is a visual toolkit for creative prototyping, to explore, transform or visualise data. It is

- open source
- local first
- does not collect any data

Everything happens inside your browser!

## Problems to solve

- As a user with no/little programming knowledge I am creatively limited by prototyping or design tools.
- As a programmer the threshold for fast and creative prototyping with code is too high.
- As a user who wants to visualize and/or interact with data, CSV or .xlsx in a visual, quick and easy way.

## Goals to reach

- Provide an extensive library of nodes to receive, transform and output data
- Make it easy to jump between visual and real coding
- Make it easy to use for mouse, trackpad and keyboard people
- Make it easy to add nodes or libraries of others
- Allow for easy sharing, forking and collaborating
- Make the tool self explanatory and build in examples and comments
- Make it cross platform and open source
