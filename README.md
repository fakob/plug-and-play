# Plug and Playground

A visual toolkit for creative prototyping to explore, transform or visualise data.

You can also access specific versions and run them locally to the right under "Releases", running these locally comes with some minor issues like missing icons.

## Problems to solve

- As a user with no/little programming knowledge I am creatively limited by prototyping or design tools.
- As a programmer the threshold for fast and creative prototyping with code is too high.
- As a user who wants to visualize and/or interact with data, CSV or .xlsx in a visual, quick and easy way.

## Goals to reach

- Provide an extensive library of nodes to receive, transform and output data
- Make it easy to jump between visual and real coding
- Make it easy to use for mouse, trackpad and keyboard people
- Make it easy to add nodes or libraries of others
- Allow for easy sharing, forking and collaborating
- Make the tool self explanatory and build in examples and comments
- Make it cross platform and open source

## Commands:

- `yarn build` - starts build procedure
- `yarn dev` - start watching for files and open's server on localhost:8080
- `yarn test` - run tests
- `yarn code-coverage` - generate code coverage report
- `yarn code-style-check` - run's eslint and prettier check on your code

## Resources:
