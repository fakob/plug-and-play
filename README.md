# Plug and Playground
A visual toolkit for creative prototyping to explore, transform or visualise data.

Work in progress - https://plugandplayground.dev

## Problems to solve
- As a user with no/little programming knowledge I am creatively limited by prototyping or design tools.
- As a programmer the threshold for fast and creative prototyping with code is too high.

## Goals to reach
- Provide an extensive library of nodes to receive, transform and output data
- Make it easy to jump between visual and real coding
- Make it easy to use for mouse, trackpad and keyboard people
- Make it easy to add nodes or libraries of others
- Allow for easy sharing, forking and collaborating
- Make the tool self explanatory and build in examples and comments
- Make it cross platform and open source

## Commands:

- `yarn build` - starts build procedure
- `yarn dev` - start watching for files and open's server on localhost:8080
- `yarn test` - run tests
- `yarn code-coverage` - generate code coverage report
- `yarn code-style-check` - run's eslint and prettier check on your code
